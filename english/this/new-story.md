Your name is Fanny Hobbart. You are in an empty theater, it looks like you fell asleep while
watching the premiere of the version control course marathon. You remain calm while you eat
the rest of your popcorn and the candy bar you found on the next seat. You look for your
purse but it's gone, you now have no money, no phone, nothing.
You see light coming out from a crack in the wall next to the big screen, it looks like
a secret door.

You decide to explore what's behind that door.

No way, you turn back and take the normal exit.
